# home directory

Files from my home directory (work, laptop and shared hosting). Forked from
[Carlo](https://github.com/carlo/homedir) who forked it from
[Brad](http://github.com/bradleywright/homedir/tree) who forked it from
[Norm](http://github.com/norm/homedir/tree).
Not forked from [hmans](https://github.com/hmans/homedir), although that's
where the first link I followed pointed.


## The Idea

One homedir git repo for all my machines. Depending on OS and machine, different
files are used and executed.


## Installation

	$ ./install.sh
